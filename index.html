            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>SAP CI Operations professional at Digitall, specializing in Cloud Technologies with a strong foundation in CI/CD. With over five years in the IT industry, I’m passionate about innovation and delivering measurable results through impactful, streamlined solutions.

                My career has been shaped by transformative projects, including major migration initiatives for Johnson Controls International (JCI) and Tyco Industries, where I gained invaluable experience in large-scale data migrations and systems integration. At SAP, I was involved in the OneStrike migration, collaborating with technical and business teams to ensure a smooth, strategic transition.
                
                Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore new technologies and expand my impact on large-scale projects. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, traveling, and deploying self-hosted applications in my home lab.</p>

                <h3>Cloud Operations Engineer</h3>
                <p><strong>Company:</strong> Digitall</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Currently, I monitor and support all aspects of the NEO environment across multiple data centers, spanning over 20 landscapes with more than 60,000 VMs running on SLES versions 12 to 15. As part of my role, I was involved in the migration to SLES 15, ensuring operational stability and performance throughout the transition.

                    I work extensively with public cloud providers, including Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and AWS, using Cloud Foundry to manage and deploy applications across these environments. This exposure allows me to leverage a broad range of cloud technologies, enhancing our system’s scalability and resilience.
                    
                    In close collaboration with development teams, I perform in-depth troubleshooting and analyze system logs to diagnose and resolve complex issues, ensuring timely and effective support in line with both internal and external service level agreements. I actively support post-mortem analysis, providing insights to development teams to help refine their products based on operational learnings. Additionally, I focus on building robust infrastructure and platform monitoring by gathering critical system metrics and implementing automated recovery tools to maintain system integrity.
                    
                    My role in this international, tech-driven environment has equipped me with a strong foundation in emerging technologies, cross-functional collaboration, and effective problem-solving to drive continuous improvement.

            <h3>Technical support analyst</h3>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> Akkodis</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to be part of transformative projects that have shaped the technological landscape of major industries. Working with Modis, I played a critical role in the mass migration initiatives for JCI (Johnson Controls International) and Tyco Industries, where I gained invaluable experience in large-scale data migrations and systems integration. These projects demanded a deep understanding of infrastructure, meticulous planning, and a collaborative approach to ensure seamless transitions without disrupting business operations.

                Through these experiences, I've developed a strong skill set in project management, data migration strategies, and cross-functional teamwork. Being able to contribute to such pivotal projects has fueled my passion for innovation and has solidified my commitment to driving impactful technological solutions in every organization I serve. </p>
