            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>SAP CI Operations professional at Digitall, specializing in Cloud Technologies with a strong foundation in CI/CD. With over five years in the IT industry, I’m passionate about innovation and delivering measurable results through impactful, streamlined solutions.

                My career has been shaped by transformative projects, including major migration initiatives for Johnson Controls International (JCI) and Tyco Industries, where I gained invaluable experience in large-scale data migrations and systems integration. At SAP, I was involved in the OneStrike migration, collaborating with technical and business teams to ensure a smooth, strategic transition.
                
                Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore new technologies and expand my impact on large-scale projects. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, traveling, and deploying self-hosted applications in my home lab.</p>
